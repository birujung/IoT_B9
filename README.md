# EnerGizmo: ESP32-Powered Smart Energy Tracker

## Overview
EnerGizmo aims to create an IoT-based Smart Electricity Energy Meter using ESP32 and the newly updated Blynk 2.0 application. The goal is to automate the process of monitoring electricity consumption and create a streamlined experience. ⚡️📊

### Background
Previously, we've developed various energy meter prototypes, including an IoT DC Energy Meter, GSM Prepaid Energy Meter, and an IoT Energy Meter using ESP32 with the old Blynk Application. With the recent upgrade of the Blynk platform, it became essential to upgrade our Energy Meter project to leverage the latest capabilities.

### Why Smart Energy Tracker?
Traditional electricity consumption monitoring involves manual meter readings, which are time-consuming and inconvenient. The Internet of Things offers a solution by automating remote data collection, saving both time and money. The global popularity of Smart Energy Meters makes it an opportune time to create our own IoT-based electricity energy meter. 🌐💡

## Project Description
We'll create an IoT-based Smart Electricity Energy Meter using ESP32 and the updated Blynk 2.0 application. Utilizing high-quality sensors like the SCT-013 for current and ZMPT101B for voltage, we'll measure voltage, current, power, and total energy consumed in kWh. The collected data will be transmitted to the Blynk 2.0 application and showcased on a dashboard accessible from any location. Additionally, to ensure continuous readings during power outages, the energy meter data will be stored in ESP32’s EEPROM. 🛠️📈

## Getting Started
To begin, follow these steps:
1. Set up the necessary hardware components (ESP32, SCT-013, ZMPT101B, etc.).
2. Install the Blynk 2.0 application and configure it for the project.
3. Upload the provided code to the ESP32 microcontroller.
4. Start monitoring electricity consumption data on the Blynk dashboard. 🚀🔌
